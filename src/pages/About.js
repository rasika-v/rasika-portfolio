            My journey in tech began during my undergraduate years, where I worked on a project - the <span>Pothole Detection Application</span>.
            This innovative solution won the <span>Smart India Hackathon 2020</span>, securing funding from AICTE and MHRD.
            The project's impact earned recognition as <span>IEEE Bangalore's Best Humanitarian Project</span>, led to a publication in the IEEE journal which I presented at IIT Guwahati, and currently has a patent pending.

            My professional journey at <span>Mercedes-Benz</span> started as an internship during my final semester, where I discovered my passion for React development. This experience evolved into a full-time role, allowing me to work with cutting-edge technologies and contribute to world-class automotive software solutions.
            I worked at Mercedes-Benz for 2.5 years before starting my next chapter.
